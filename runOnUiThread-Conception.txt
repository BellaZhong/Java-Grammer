runOnUiThread  &  Handler  Difference and Relatives.

Handler, Looper, MessageQueue, Thread are Asyn communication methods in Android.
They're similar to MsBox in uC/OS-II. Android rules that UI can't be changed outside from the main UI Thread.
So when there's a need to change the UI in sub-threads, we need to pass the messages back to main UI Thread, so the UI will be changed in main Thread.


Define a Handler in a class, and override the run methods to post the messages to the main Thread. Under default circumstances, the Handler will be bound to 
the Looper of the class which defined the Handler. Otherwise, the Handler will specifically be assigned to a certain Looper.

Looper is the bridge to connect Handler and MessageQueue.
A class has only one Looper.
A Looper can have multiple Handlers.
A Handler belongs to only one Looper.


A Handler can be attached to any Looper.
But runOnUiThread will only be bound to the main UI Thread.

So a Handler can post messages to any threads.
But runOnUiThread will only post messages to the main UI Thread to change UI.
